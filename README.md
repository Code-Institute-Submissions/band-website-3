Webstite for a band

# the project
Create a front-end-only webpage for a 1960 rock band. The goal of the website was to give an impression of 60's and emotions related to rock music and live envents. Sample music and links to amazon have been included.

# technology
For the purpose of the project I used:
- html / html audio/video
- css
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 4

# responsiveness
The page is responsive. Works well on smartphones. I have encountered some CSS issues with iPhone (background-attachement: fixed seems to bo blocked on Safari). Solved the problem with help of media query.
